Oh my god! Thank you so much!
Really? Are you sure they will be interested in meeting an intern?
Thank you Mrs Azzi. I’ll be honoured to work with a person of your experience and success!

Don’t get excited. It will not be so easy. You are still new here and you have to prove that you deserve such an opportunity.
You need to stop doubting yourself, otherwise you will not progress in this company.
Don’t be a bootlicker, please. You’ve been spending too much time in here.

I am sorry I didn’t reply to your message. It was my day off and I wanted to spend some time with my girlfriend.
Oh, I read your message, but then I had a busy weekend with my girlfriend and I totally forgot about it!
Oh, sorry about that. How exactly did you find my number, though?

I am always available when I am here.
What does that mean?
I don’t think this is very PROFFESSIONAL, Jason.

Jason

Oh, right. I understand. However, you should always be available when you have a job like that.
Yeah sure.. I wanted to ask about any ideas you might have, but you were.. busy..
Erm.. The company has the details of all its employees, so my pal in HR helped a bit. Happens all the time.

You need to be avaliable at all times especially to me.
Nothing at all, I apologise if I offended you.
Aw, don’t tell me you think that’s creepy. All the senior members can have these ‘perks’.
