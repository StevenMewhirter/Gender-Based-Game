Hey, stranger! What's up?
Finally! I was worried sick! Are you ok?
What the hell Katie? Where have you been?

No, I am fine, thanks babes.
Why didn't you answer my texts? I was very worried

I am so sorry, but you see the state of me, I can't even speak properly, I'm going to take a shower now, make yourself comfortable.
I am just going to lie on the bed for a while, I am not feeling very well.

She is lying for sure! If she was ill, she would have all her medicine out. I know her.
Something else is going on. Let's see if I can find anything that will answer my questions.
